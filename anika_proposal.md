**Project Name: DemocraSee** 


**Old Project**


**Team Project**


## Description

**DemocraSee is a one stop shop for all things related to voter information. Our goal is to increase transparency and de-mystify the democratic process by giving an unbiased view of each candidate's platform, funding, and history. Our features include a quiz to determine political preference including which candidates most closely align with your views, a financial contribution tracker for each candidate, a page to track which candidates you're voting for, and a notification system to ensure voters are prepared on Election Day.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

1. **Implementing quiz logic**
2. **Potential merge conflicts**
3. **Displaying data visually**
4. **Finding unbiased candidate content**

## Skateboard

**OpenFEC API implemented and candidate data displayed.** 

## Bike

**Allow each user CRUD functionality for candidates (i.e. a "my candidates" page).** 

## Car

**Quiz to determine political preference.**

## Personal Achievement Goals:

### Teammate 1: Anika
