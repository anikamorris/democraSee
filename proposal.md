# Proposal

I'm going to build an informative website that helps people keep track of the Democratic primary field.
I want to give information on each candidate, including their history, domestic policy platform, foreign policy platform, and funding. I'll be using the FEC's OpenFEC API to get data on each candidate's cash on hand, small dollar donations, and large dollar donations.
